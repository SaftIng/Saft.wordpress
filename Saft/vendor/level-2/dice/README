====

Dice is a minimalist Dependency Injection Container for PHP.


Installation

Updates
------------

28/02/2014
Added basic namespace support. Documentation update will follow shortly. Also moved the XML loader into its own file, you'll need to include it separately if you're using it.

Please note: CHANGES WERE NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. However they are easily fixed by doing the following find/replaces:

new Dice => new \Dice\Dice
new DiceInstance => new \Dice\Instance
new DiceRule => new \Dice\Rule

This version is no longer compatible with PHP5.2 or lower.
